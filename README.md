# Celestia Incentivized Testnet Participation

Welcome to the Celestia Incentivized Testnet repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository chronicles my dynamic engagement in the Celestia incentivized testnet, the Blockspace Race, during the pivotal year of 2023. The program, designed to scrutinize transactions, delegate to validators, and interact with the testnet environment, underscored the significance of over 700 light nodes.

## Key Contributions

As a chosen participant, my documented contributions spanned multiple phases, earning rewards for proactive involvement. For an in-depth analysis of my performance, check out [my article](https://medium.com/@mztacat/performance-analysis-for-celestia-light-node-by-mztacat-62a85752266d).

## Light Node Challenge

Participating in the Light Node Challenge in May 2023 was a distinctive experience. The challenge inspired creative and entertaining ways to run Celestia light nodes, showcasing the versatility of the network.

## Performance Analysis

For a detailed breakdown of my performance analysis for the Celestia Light Node, explore [this comprehensive report](https://medium.com/@mztacat/performance-analysis-for-celestia-light-node-by-mztacat-62a85752266d). This analysis delves into the intricacies of my contributions, providing valuable insights into the node's efficiency and effectiveness.

## Light Node Monitoring Tool

To complement the analysis, I've developed a [Light Node Monitoring Tool](https://github.com/mztacat/Celestia-Light-Node-Monitiring-Tool) available in this repository. This tool enhances the monitoring capabilities, offering a valuable resource for anyone keen on optimizing Celestia light nodes.

## Impact

Being part of the Celestia incentivized testnet was not just about personal achievements; it was a substantial contribution to the network's development. This program served as a crucial milestone, allowing developers to refine aspects of the Celestia network before its mainnet launch.

## Community Achievements

Our collective success in the Celestia incentivized testnet laid a solid foundation for the continued evolution and triumph of the Celestia network. Your active involvement is pivotal to our community's achievements.

Thank you for being part of the Celestia journey! ðŸŒŒ
